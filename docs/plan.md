# Improvement Plan for Gratta e Vinci Digitale

This document outlines a comprehensive improvement plan for the Farmacia Sammaruga Digital Scratch Card application. The plan is based on the requirements specified in the project documentation and is organized by functional areas.

## 1. Project Overview

### Current State
The project is currently in its initial stage with only the default Flutter application template. No specific functionality for the digital scratch card system has been implemented yet.

### Project Goals
Create a Flutter-based digital scratch card application for Farmacia Sammaruga that:
- Provides an engaging and playful user experience
- Allows pharmacy operators to manage scratch card distribution
- Enables customers to use digital scratch cards
- Tracks and displays prize information
- Operates completely offline with local data storage

## 2. User Interface Design

### Branding and Visual Identity
- **Rationale**: Consistent branding reinforces the pharmacy's identity and creates a professional appearance.
- **Proposed Changes**:

  - Create a playful and engaging interface appropriate for a game-like application
  - Ensure "Farmacia Sammaruga" appears in the header of all screens
  - Develop a visually appealing scratch card effect

### Screen Flow and Navigation
- **Rationale**: A clear navigation structure ensures both operators and customers can easily use the application.
- **Proposed Changes**:
  - Implement a splash screen with "Farmacia Sammaruga" and "Gratta e Vinci" text
  - Create a logical flow between operator screens and customer-facing screens
  - Add a lock icon button for returning to operator mode
  - Add a settings icon for accessing configuration options

## 3. Core Functionality

### Authentication System
- **Rationale**: PIN protection prevents unauthorized access to operator functions.
- **Proposed Changes**:
  - Implement a 4-digit PIN authentication system for operator access
  - Create a PIN change functionality in settings
  - Ensure secure local storage of PIN information

### Scratch Card Mechanics

- **Proposed Changes**:
  - Create interface for operators to set number of available scratch cards
  - Implement session management to track remaining cards
  - Add functionality to reset/start new sessions
  - Develop a screen lock after all attempts are used

## 4. Settings and Configuration

### Prize Configuration
- **Rationale**: Flexible prize configuration allows the pharmacy to customize promotions.

  - Create CRUD interface for prize management
  - Implement probability settings for each prize
  - Ensure probabilities are correctly applied in the game logic
  - Add validation to prevent invalid configurations

### System Settings
- **Rationale**: Basic system settings enable customization of the application.
- **Proposed Changes**:
  - Implement PIN change functionality
  - Add configuration for total number of virtual scratch cards
  - Create interface for viewing prize history and statistics

## 5. Data Management

### Local Storage
- **Rationale**: The application must function offline with all data stored locally.
- **Proposed Changes**:
  - Implement secure local storage for configuration data
  - Create a database structure for prize history
  - Ensure data persistence across application restarts
  - Add data export functionality for reporting purposes

## 6. Testing and Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy
- **Rationale**: Comprehensive testing ensures a reliable and bug-free application.
- **Proposed Changes**:
  - Develop unit tests for core game logic
  - Implement widget tests for UI components
  - Create integration tests for complete user flows
  - Test on both Android and iOS tablet devices

### Performance Optimization
- **Rationale**: The application should run smoothly on all supported devices.
- **Proposed Changes**:
  - Optimize animations and visual effects
  - Ensure responsive design for different tablet sizes
  - Minimize memory usage and battery consumption

## 7. Implementation Roadmap
